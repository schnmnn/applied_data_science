Definition of
Long-term interest rates
Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. 
Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. 
Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. 
These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, 
not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. 
Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. 
Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. 
Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.
